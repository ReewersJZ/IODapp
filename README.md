### General info
The aim of the project was to create a web application for managing GDPR documentation. It includes a training module, a risk analysis module and a financial module.

The application is still being expanded to create the perfect dependency diagram between modules and ultimately create a commercial, well-coded version.

This version has been used since August 2020 mainly to present GDPR thematic training for employees.

The pandemic and lockdown were the reasons for writing this type of application because it was not possible to train employees using the traditional method. The application was created as a non-profit project.
